# CrossAutoFunctions
## Analysing incoming data from a network of air quality instruments.

![](/Users/gmis011/Documents/projects/christchurchPMNetwork/auto_cross_image.pdf)

The package sets the data up as either: <br>
- **Cross** Where results are compared to the latest results from across the network. <br>
- **Auto** Where results are compared to the recent history from the examined location.

A collection of data-driven tests ($\gamma$) are also provided for checking the data, which could be weighted ($\omega$) and summed to give a single value reporting on reliability.
